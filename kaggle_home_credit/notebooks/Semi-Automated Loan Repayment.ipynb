    "# A Smarter Approach: Semi-Automated Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "The manual feature engineering approach is extremely inefficient. It often involves writing the same exact code over and over again to do very similar results mostly dealing with grouping, aggregating, and merging. Anytime we start to repeat code, we have to ask is there a more efficient way to do this? The answer of course is yes as we will shortly see. In this notebook, we will take another approach to feature engineering, one halfway between purely manual and automated: we will call this approach __semi-automated modeling__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind semi-automated modeling is to take many of the repeated actions and encode them in functions where they can be used repeatedly with only the arguments (inputs to the function) changing rather than the syntax itself. Although this still does not allow for complete re-usability across problems, it will create a much more efficient workflow. Moreover, we will be able to create thousands of features, which was not a possibility when we were making features one at a time spending 15 minutes on each feature! \n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop two primary functions for handling data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `agg_numeric`: calculate statistics (`mean`, `max`, `min`, `sum`, `count`) of the numeric variables across all the children of each parent individual in a child table.\n",
    "2. `agg_categorical`: calculate the `sum`, `mean`, and `count` for each unique category of each categorical variable across all the children of each parent individual in a child table. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to completely summarize a child table such as `bureau`, we need to run the first function and then the second, merging the results at the end. We can build on these two functions by writing higher level functions that do these actions for us. Likewise, the grandchildren dataframes require multiple applications of both `agg_numeric` and `agg_categorical`, and we will also write a function to perform all of these operations for us. As a reminder, there are four grandchildren dataframes and two child dataframes. The two higher level functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `agg_child`: completely aggregate a child table for each observation of a parent\n",
    "2. `agg_grandchild`: completely aggregate a grandchild table at the grandparent level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have aggregated the six total tables besides `app`, we then merge together all of the data onto `app` by the `SK_ID_CURR` to arrive at one dataframe that can be split back into the training and testing sets. "

    "## Numeric Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "While we were building features one at a time because we wanted to use domain knowledge, if we take the position that we no longer care about the phyiscal representation of the feature, we can easily make hundreds of features that are not limited by our imagination and supposed knowledge. We will call this process __semi-automated feature engineering__ because while it is not automated all the way, we use functions that can repeatedly carry out multiple operations for us without requiring us to manually type them in every time. This will allow for much more efficient workflows and we can still encode domain knowledge by adding features one at a time in addition to the numerous feature from the semi-automated method. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we limited ourselves to doing aggregations one at a time and using only counts, sums, and means. However, there is nothing stopping us from using other aggregations and performing them all at once. As an implementation of this idea, the code below finds the `count`, `mean`, `max`, `min`, and `sum` of all the numeric columns in the `bureau` dataframe."

    "The categorical variables from the children tables also need to be incorporated into the main data. With the application data, we one-hot encoded the variables and then used these directly as features. For the children data tables, we can take a similar approach but with an added aggregation step after one-hot encoding to create one row for each parent. In the traditional feature engineering this was done using sums, but again we do not have to limit ourselves to one aggregation (we will use `sum`,`mean`, and `count`). We also can use all of the categorical features at once instead of picking and choosing single columns or values.\n",

For example, in the `bureau_balance` dataframe, there is monthly information on the loans in `bureau`. To get this data into the `app` dataframe will first require grouping the monthly information for each loan and then grouping the loans for each client. \n",

As one example, `BB_CLIENT_BB_LOAN_MONTHS_BALANCE_count_mean` is the client's average number of records per previous loan. This is formed by `count`ing the number of `MONTHS_BALANCE` for each previous loan and then taking the `mean` of this across a clients loans. Another column is `BB_CLIENT_BB_LOAN_MONTHS_BALANCE_min_mean` which represents a client's average minimum `MONTHS_BALANCE` for each loan. That is, find the minimum `MONTHS_BALANCE` for each loan, and then average these across a client's previous loans.

    "Semi-automated feature engineering is a more efficient approach than traditional manual feature engineering. By writing functions rather than hand-coding each feature, we can add hundreds of features at once and re-use the functions for multiple tables. In comparison to manual feature engineering, the semi-automated approach is quicker (in terms of time per feature), less error-prone, and more repeatable across datasets. Overall, semi-automated feature engineering is a much more efficient process although we may lose a little in terms of domain knowledge in the resulting features. Moreover, if we are going to the trouble of semi-automated feature engineering, why not take the step to full automation?\n",

    "Both methods have their advantages and drawbacks. __The traditional method resulted in 30 new features, with an average time to make each feature of over 15 miuntes. These features turned out to be very important in the final model. The semi-automated approach created 1173 features with about 10 total hours of work on the functions. This represents a time per feature of 0.51 minutes. The much larger number of features must be weighed against the usefulness of these features as many of them have no importance to the model.__\n",
