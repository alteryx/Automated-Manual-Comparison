    "# Predicting Remaining Useful Life using Automated Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting how long an engine, or any part for that matter, will last, is an incredibly important problem in engineering. Traditionally, companies have relied on manual inspection, which is error-prone and often can be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at an automated approach to feature engineering for this time-series problem. We'll use Featurestools, the only open-source library for automated feature engineering to create a rich set of features in order to train machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous notebook, we accomplished this task using manual feature engineering, with the basic implementation achieving:\n",
    "\n",
    "__5-fold Cross Validation MAPE: 46.62 Test MAPE: 51.48. These features took 120 minutes to build including time for understanding the data and for implementing the code.__ \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the manual notebook, we defined the prediction problem by selecting Prediction Points in the data and then using the label as the number of weeks from this point to failure. The observational data was submitted to only periods from before this prediction point to ensure the data is valid. To make a fair comparison between manual and automated approaches, we'll load in the same exact data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The metric we established is __Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)__, an interpretable measure that is the percentage error from our predictions. We'll measure MAPE both in 5-fold cross validation on the training data and on the test data (for which we know the true labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fairly straightforward time-series problem once we have the data segmented into labels and allowable training data. Automated feature engineering is a series of steps using Featuretools\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an EntitySet and add entities to it\n",
    "    * Add dataframes and then normalize to create parent-child tables\n",
    "2. Add relationships between Entities\n",
    "    * When normalizing tables this is done automatically\n",
    "3. Run deep feature synthesis using basic primitives\n",
    "4. Define custom primitives to enhance the capabilities of featuretools\n",
    "5. Compare feature sets using a default Random Forest Regressor\n",
    "6. Optimize the model using random search\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll try out some of the more advanced aspects of Featuretools that can help us get the most from our results.\n"

We'll do the same basic idea in Featuretools, but our method will be slightly different. First we'll _normlize_ the `obs` data by the engine. This will create a table with one row for each engine where the index is the `engine_no`. Then, when we build features our of the observational data, we can specify this table as where we want to build our features. This is done using `normalize_entity` with the following arguments:\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand deep feature synthesis (DFS), we first have to grasp feature primitives. A feature primitive a at a very high-level is an operation applied to data to create a feature. These represent very simple calculations that can be stacked on top of each other to create complex features. Feature primitives fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Aggregation__ (`agg`): function that groups together child datapoints for each parent and then calculates a statistic such as mean, min, max, or standard deviation. An example is calculating the maximum loan amount for each client. An aggregation works across multiple tables using relationships between tables.\n",
    "* __Transformation__ (`trans`): an operation applied to one or more columns in a single table. An example would be extracting the day from dates, or finding the difference between two columns in one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep feature synthesis takes feature primitives and stacks them on top of each other to create new features. The depth of a feature is the number of primitives, so, for example, taking the mean of a maximum would be a feature of depth 2. Because we only have two tables in this case, we'll stick to features with depth of 1. When doing manual engineering, all of the features we created were essentially \"deep features\" since we made them by aggregating child observations for each parent. Featuretools will do this for us in deep feature synthesis but with a clean interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a basic example of running deep feature synthesis using `ft.dfs`. We'll specify to build the features for each engine (`target_entity = engines`), list a few `agg` and `trans` primitives, a maximum depth of 1, and `n_jobs=-1` to run on all cores."
