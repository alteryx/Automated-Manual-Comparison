    "# Manual Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "[Feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) is the process of creating new features (also called explanatory or predictor variables) out of an existing dataset to help a machine learning model train for a prediction problem. In many cases, the data is spread across numerous related tables linked by specific variables (known as keys). Because a machine learning model can only use a single table when training/predicting, feature engineering requires consolidating all the features in one table that has a single row for each observation with the columns containing the features. Once the data has been gathered into a single table, a machine learning model is trained on the training data and then assessed by making predictions on the hold-out testing data. Feature engineering is generally [considered the most important step of the machine learning pipeline](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf) because a model can only learn from the data it is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, feature engineering is carried out by hand, often involving domain expertise to try and capture as many useful relationships as possible. Feature engineering can also be empirically driven, by relying on past features that have proven useful for other problems. It can also be done naively, by creating as many features as possible with no consideration beforehand of their physical relevance to the problem. Then, the features that are most useful are retained or built upon in subsequent iterations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While feature engineering is crucial to the success of a machine learning project, it can also be extremely tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, humans are limited both by time constraints and by creativity when it comes to designing new features. As a result, it is impossible to know when all the options for new features have been exhuasted and if the resulting set of features is as good as it could be. The ultimate dream technique in machine learning would be a method to automatically build hundreds or thousands of useful features from a set of related data tables. This technology would not replace the data scientist, but would allow here to overcome the inherent human limitations and spend more time on other important aspects of the machine learning pipeline such as prediction engineering or interpreting the model results. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through the steps of manual feature engineering for a machine learning task. We will build domain knowledge features, new features based on those that have proved important in previous modeling, and by naive creating thousands of new features using statistical aggregations. \n",

    "## Problem and Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Home Credit Default Risk competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) currently running on Kaggle is a supervised classification task where the objective is to predict whether or not an applicant (known as a client) will default on loan. The data comprises socio-economic indicators for the clients, loan specific financial information, and comprehensive data on previous loans at Home Credit (the institution sponsoring the competition) and other credit bureaus. The metric for this competition is Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC). Submissions to the public leaderboard are ranked based on 10% of the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Credit Default Risk dataset ([available for download](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data)) consists of seven tables of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* application_train/application_test: the main training/testing data for each client at Home Credit. The information includes both socioeconomic indicators for the client and loan-specific characteristics. Each loan has its own row and is uniquely identified by the feature `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid. \n",
    "* bureau: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions (not Home Credit). Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one client in the application data can have multiple previous credits. The previous credits are uniquely identified by the feature `SK_ID_BUREAU`.\n",
    "* bureau_balance: monthly balance data about the credits in bureau. Each row has information for one month about a previous credit and a single previous credit can have multiple rows. This is linked backed to the bureau loan data by `SK_ID_BUREAU` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",
    "* previous_application: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each client in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row in this dataframe and is uniquely identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n",
    "* POS_CASH_BALANCE: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans from the previous loan data. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows. This is linked backed to the previous loan data by `SK_ID_PREV` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",
    "* credit_card_balance: monthly data about previous credit cards loans from the previous loan data. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows. This is linked backed to the previous loan data by `SK_ID_PREV` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",
    "* installments_payment: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. This is linked backed to the previous loan data by `SK_ID_PREV` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",

New features can be made by manipulating columns from the original `application` data (such as dividing or subtracting two columns) or by using the children data tables. The children data tables must be grouped by a parent variable (such as `SK_ID_CURR`) and then aggregated for the parent. We will discuss child and parent tables shortly after we work with creating features from the main dataframe.  \n",

    "Before doing any feature engineering, it's important to establish a __baseline performance measure__. This will let us get a sense if feature engineering improves the model, and by how much. Throughtout this project, we will use the [Gradient Boosting Machine](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/01/23/a-kaggle-master-explains-gradient-boosting/), in particular, the implementation from the [LightGBM library](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). For a baseline model, we will use the default hyperparameters values and the initial set of features from the `app` data. The number of estimators will be selected using early stopping for 100 rounds with 5-fold cross validation. This means that the number of estimators trained (`n_estimators` or `num_boost_rounds`) will be determined by the number of estimators that yields the highest performance metric as determined by 5-fold cross validation. Early stopping alleviates the need to choose the number of estimators and is an effective regularization technique for preventing overfitting to the training data."

For the Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk competition, [many kernels ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/kernels) have been developed by a community of thousands of data scientists documenting useful features that have been constructed both by using domain knowledge and through trial and error. This section relies on heavily on a number of kernels, most notably\n",

Although not given in the original data, this can be calculated by dividing the loan annuity,`AMT_ANNUITY`, by the total amount of the loan `AMT_CREDIT`. This may be useful because a higher risk loan will probably have a higher interest rate because it is more likely to default. "

Although the correlation coefficient only measures linear relationships, it can serve as an approximation for which features may be important for a prediction problem. "

For example, when building a model using the Gradient Boosting Machine (as implemented in LightGBM), we can examine the feature importances from the model. We can then use the features considered most important by the model to construct new features that hopefully capture additional information from these features. \n",

This average would then form a single new column in the parent dataframe.

This is formed by `count`ing the number of `MONTHS_BALANCE` for each previous loan and then taking the `mean` of this across a clients loans. Another column is `BB_CLIENT_BB_LOAN_MONTHS_BALANCE_min_mean` which represents a client's average minimum `MONTHS_BALANCE` for each loan. That is, find the minimum `MONTHS_BALANCE` for each loan, and then average these across a client's previous loans.

We can also use modeling results in the form of features importances to select only the n-most important features or the features comprising a certain percentage of the total feature importance. "
